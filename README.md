# Happy Commit — Birthday Surprise Page

This is a single-file static birthday surprise page (HTML/CSS/JS) designed to show a cake, candle, animations, and a small interactive surprise flow. It was edited locally in this workspace and is ready to be pushed to a GitHub repository.

Key files
- `index.html` — the full page (HTML, inline CSS, inline JavaScript). Replace placeholder media (e.g., `music.mp3`, `video.mp4`) with your actual assets.

How to publish to GitHub (PowerShell)
1. Initialize git (if not already):

   git init

2. Add files and commit:

   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit — Happy Commit birthday page"

3. Add the remote and push (replace with your preferred branch name):

   git remote add origin https://github.com/Aftab1272/happycommit.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

Authentication notes
- If Git prompts for username/password, use a Personal Access Token (PAT) as the password (recommended). Or use the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`) to authenticate and then push.

If you want, I can also:
- create a small `package.json` (dev preview) or a `README` badge
- prepare a ZIP for upload
- or generate a small deploy script for GitHub Pages

Tell me what you want me to do next.
